Description: Tools to perform hierarchical inference for one or multiple 
    studies / data sets based on high-dimensional multivariate (generalised) 
    linear models. A possible application is to perform hierarchical inference 
    for GWA studies to find significant groups or single SNPs (if the signal 
    is strong) in a data-driven and automated procedure. The method is based 
    on an efficient hierarchical multiple testing correction and controls the 
    FWER. The functions can easily be run in parallel.
